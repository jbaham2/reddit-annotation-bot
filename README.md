#Reddit Annotation Bot

This is a reddit bot that will select the desired number of posts from the subreddit of chance, or a particular reddit id, and scans the comments for links. The bot then strips the url out of the markdown and replies to the comment with with all the urls in an ordered list.

I'm including a list of features that I had planned for the bot in hopes that someone will pick it up and finish the list. Reddit apparently bans this type of bot so be sneaky.

This bot uses the PRAW and CommonRegex modules. Thanks guys/girls.

###I wrote this bot for my first program as a challenge from a quasi-tutor/mentor (He's really busy). Thanks Jon.

=====================

This is a bot I wrote for my first program. It scrapes the urls out of markdown in reddit comments then replies with the urls as an ordered list of links.
